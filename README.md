## Run Locally

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Monesh782005/blogcraft.git
cd blogcraft
```

### 2. Run the frontend

Serve the project root using a local static server, such as:

```bash
npx serve .
```

Open the local URL provided by the server.

### 3. Run the backend

Open a separate terminal:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with your own configuration:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_secret
```

Start the backend using the available npm script:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Make sure your frontend API configuration points to your local backend when testing locally.

## Project Purpose

This project helped me gain practical experience in frontend development, REST API integration, authentication, database connectivity, and deployment.
